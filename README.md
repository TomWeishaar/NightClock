# NightClock
Simple HTML NightClock (BIG text) for Chromebooks.

I wear glasses. But not in bed. When I'm travelling, I've been using ALARMd (https://www.zachleat.com/alarmd/) on my laptop as a night clock. It has, er had, an option to make the time appear on the screen in huge text that I could read from across the room without my glasses.

I just got a Pixelbook, however, and I'd like to travel with it instead. But the version of ALARMd I've been using doesn't work as an offline file on a Pixelbook (it can't find its CSS and JavaScript files) and a newer version of ALARMd doesn't even have the option for huge text(!).

How hard can a simple NightClock be? Turns out not very. With the help of Tushar Gupta's answer to a StackOver question (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18229022/how-to-show-current-time-in-javascript-in-the-format-hhmmss) I was able to pull together this simple app with everything it needs embedded in the html.

It has no options whatsoever. However, you can edit the CSS yourself if you like.
