# NightClock
Simple HTML NightClock (BIG text) for browsers.

I wear glasses. But not in bed. When I'm travelling, I've been using ALARMd (https://www.zachleat.com/alarmd/) on my laptop as a night clock. It has, er had, an option to make the time appear on the screen in huge text that I could read from across the room without my glasses.

I just got a Pixelbook, however, and I'd like to travel with it instead. But the version of ALARMd I've been using doesn't work as an offline file on a Pixelbook (it can't find its CSS and JavaScript files) and a newer version of ALARMd doesn't even have the option for huge text(!).

How hard can a simple NightClock be? Turns out not very. With the help of Tushar Gupta's answer to a Stackoverflow question (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18229022/how-to-show-current-time-in-javascript-in-the-format-hhmmss), I was able to pull together this tiny app (this README is longer than the code!) with everything it needs embedded in the html.

It has no options whatsoever. However, you can edit the CSS yourself if you like.

If you actually use this with Chrome on a Pixelbook, you will find it helpful to know that the Pixelbook option to "Keep display on" is under Settings/Device/Power/When idle. The fourth key in the top row maximizes the screen (ie, hides the browser controls), and sixth and seventh keys control screen brightness. For nightime use, I turn the screen all the way down until it's off, then brighten it just one notch. Also, in some cases you may need to change the Pixelbook's time zone by hand; if so, that's in Settings/Advanced/Date and time.

With other systems you probably want to find these options before travelling. Sleep well.
